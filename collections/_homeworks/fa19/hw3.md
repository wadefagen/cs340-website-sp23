# Homework 3 Details

Homework 3 will focus on doing homeworks within the PrairieLearn interface.

- For each programming question, you will have **ten** attempts, allowing you to debug code if your code did not work the first attempt.


## Getting Started

When you start Homework 3, you will see the message *"Please wait until instructed to start by a proctor"*.  Since this a homework, this is not necessary, you can begin whenever you are ready!
