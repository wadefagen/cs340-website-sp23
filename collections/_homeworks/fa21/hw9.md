MapReduce is one of the fundamental algorithms for processing big data.  The technology was first published by Google's Research division in 2004 (just 17 years ago) and now it's used by millions of users.

Here's the PDF of their original paper:

## Homework

Read the first four pages (Abstract, Section 1, Section 2, and beginning of Section 3) of Google's paper and browse through the rest of the paper (*it's a great paper and worth reading the full paper if you're interested in all the technical details*).

After reading the paper:
- Provide an one-sentence description of the example code they provide in the paper,
- Provide an example input that might be used with their example code,
- Provide the output of their result to your sample input (it's a set of key-value pairs, which is easily represented in JSON format)

Submit your homework as a Markdown file named `hw9.md` in the root of your CS 240 repository, formatted in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
