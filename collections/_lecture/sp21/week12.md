## Non-Instruction Day on Tuesday

This Tuesday, April 13, is the final COVID-19 non-instruction day.  The only CS 240 activity this week will be MP8 -- there will be no lecture and no homework due.  We will hold regular office hours.

### Upcoming Midterm Exam: April 29, 2021

The CS 240 midterm exam is a little over two weeks away -- on April 29 -- and we will have a practice exam for you next week.  This exam will focus more on the design of microservices and will involve you designing your own microservice and programming a simple service like you have been doing for MP6 - MP8.
