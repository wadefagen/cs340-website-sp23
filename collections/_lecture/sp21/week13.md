## Course Meetup: Tuesday, Apr. 20

The next course meetup at on **Tuesday, Apr. 20 at 12:30pm on Zoom**.


### Upcoming Midterm Exam: April 29

The second midterm exam for CS 240 is coming up in under two weeks on Thursday, April 29.  This exam will consist of a microservice design question -- similar to the MPs you have been doing -- and a small microservice programming question.

A sample midterm [is available here](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs240/sp2021/pages/sample-midterm2.html).


### Lecture Handout

- Lecture Handout for Week #13: [PDF](/cs240/sp2021/static/lectures/cs240_wk13_lectureHandout.pdf)

As you go through the lecture notes, you can print this out or use a tablet to fill in key ideas from the notes!  They're designed to cover the same sample problems you'll see in the lecture notes! :)



## Lecture Topics

In our previous course meetup, we chatted about exploring a hybrid approach to lecture notes.  This week is a first pass at this approach with three detailed articles:

<ol>
  {% for link in page.videos %}
  <li>
      <a href="{{ link.first[1] }}">{{ link.first[0] }}</a>
  </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ol>
