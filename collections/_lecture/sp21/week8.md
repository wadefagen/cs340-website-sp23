## Course Meetup: Tuesday, Mar. 16

The next course meetup at on **Tuesday, Mar. 16 at 12:30pm on Zoom**.  We will use the same link all semester long (same as last week, and you can find it in Compass 2g as the only announcement for CS 240).

### Midterm Exam Information

The CS 240 Midterm #1 exam is on **Thursday, Mar. 18**.

- You will have 90 minutes to complete the exam.
- You can take the exam anytime during the day on Thursday (the exam will become available at midnight early March 18 and close at 11:59pm on March 18).  I will send an e-mail on Wednesday night as a reminder. :)
- The exam is open notes, open book, open Google, but **closed other people**.  You can do anything except chat with another person about the exam during the exam.
- The format of the exam will be identical to the practice exam available on [PrairieLearn](https://prairielearn.engr.illinois.edu/pl/).
- *(Note: Due to the exam, all office hours will **not** be held on March 18 since we cannot answer questions about content that might be on the exam.)*


## Lecture Handouts

- Lecture Handout for Week #8: [PDF](/cs240/sp2021/static/lectures/cs240_wk8_lectureHandout.pdf)

As you go through the lecture notes, you can print this out or use a tablet to fill in key ideas from the notes!  They're designed to cover the same sample problems you'll see in the lecture notes! :)


## Lecture Topics

In our previous course meetup, we chatted about exploring a hybrid approach to lecture notes.  This week is a first pass at this approach with three detailed articles:

<ol>
  {% for link in page.videos %}
  <li>
      <a href="{{ link.first[1] }}">{{ link.first[0] }}</a>
  </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ol>
