## Course Meetup: Tuesday, Mar. 23

The next course meetup at on **Tuesday, Mar. 23 at 12:30pm on Zoom**.  We will use the same link all semester long (same as last week, and you can find it in Compass 2g as the only announcement for CS 240).

### Note: COVID-19 Non-Instruction Day

This Wednesday (Mar. 24) is the second of three COVID-19 "Non-Instruction Day". Since CS 240 does not have any scheduled activities on Wednesdays, this will not impact the course.

However, the final "Non-Instruction Day" is finally on a Tuesday (April 13).  For that week, we will have no lecture make certain to have a significantly easier week with less work presented and due during the week since our course is a Tuesday/Thursday class and you're off for 50% of that week. :)


## Lecture Handouts

- Lecture Handout for Week #9: [PDF](/cs240/sp2021/static/lectures/cs240_wk9_lectureHandout.pdf)

As you go through the lecture notes, you can print this out or use a tablet to fill in key ideas from the notes!  They're designed to cover the same sample problems you'll see in the lecture notes! :)


## Lecture Topics

In our previous course meetup, we chatted about exploring a hybrid approach to lecture notes.  This week is a first pass at this approach with three detailed articles:

<ol>
  {% for link in page.videos %}
  <li>
      <a href="{{ link.first[1] }}">{{ link.first[0] }}</a>
  </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ol>
