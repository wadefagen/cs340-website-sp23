# Exam Week - Extra Credit

In lecture, you learned about **conditional variables** as a means to remove busy waiting and use idle waiting to make your solution more efficient.  To earn +5 EC points, improve your MP5 solution:

- Remove all forms of busy waiting for your MP5 solution, **and**
- Ensure your MP5 does not leak any memory,

To earn the EC points, your MP must also be fully functional (ex: pass all the requirements described in MP5).  You should work on your MP5 extra credit by modifying your MP5 code in your MP5 folder.
