#### Pre-Lecture for Lecture {{page.number}}

Run the code `04cr.c` and `04rc.c` from Lecture #4's code: [https://github.com/cs240-illinois/sp22_cs240_.lecture/tree/main/04](https://github.com/cs240-illinois/sp22_cs240_.lecture/tree/main/04).  To do this:

- Compile `04cr` by running `gcc 04cr.c -o 04cr` and then run `time ./04cr` to have Linux/MacOS X report how long it took to run.
- Repeat this for `gcc 04rc.c -o 04rc` and run `time ./04rc` to report the time.
- Record your times to bring to lecture.
- Think about why they're different and bring the times they took to lecture on Tuesday.

We'll start off by collecting the times you found and use that to lead it into a course-wide discussion on what is happening to find the differences!
