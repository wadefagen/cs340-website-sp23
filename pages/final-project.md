# Final Project

A major part of systems is building individual components that work together with a larger system as part of a large team.  Our final project involves creating exactly that kind of system.

We discussed details in lecture and this page provides the collection of all project-related resources


## Stub Datastore

To get started programming on your specific microservice, I've created a stub datastore that will be useful for you in interact with the datastore until the real datastore is ready.

- This stub datastore follows the guidelines outlined in the specification document, but does not store any data and returns hard-coded sample data.
- This will help you test your microservice.
- Full Code: [https://github-dev.cs.illinois.edu/cs240-fa20/_release/tree/final-project-stub-datastore/final-project-stub-datastore](https://github-dev.cs.illinois.edu/cs240-fa20/_release/tree/final-project-stub-datastore/final-project-stub-datastore)


Optionally, you can merge it into your team's final project git using the usual commands:
```
# Add the `release` remote to your project directory (if you haven't already):
git remote add release https://github-dev.cs.illinois.edu/cs240-fa20/_release.git

# Merge in `final-project-stub-datastore`:
git fetch release
git merge release/final-project-stub-datastore -m "Merging final-project-stub-datastore"
```

*If someone on your team has already merged it in, you should not re-merge it.  Instead, you can just `git pull`.*
