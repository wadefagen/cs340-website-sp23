# Keep Nerding Out #1

### Treasure Hunt

I have uploaded a file just for you in an AWS S3 bucket!  **Go find it! :)**

- The name of the file is the SHA-256 hash of your NetID, with a `.txt` extension added to the end of the hash.

- I only used lowercase letters (in both your NetID and the SHA-256 hash).

- Use Python and S3 APIs to access the file:
  - The bucket name is `waf-uiuc-cs340`.
  - To access it, you will need to use the Access Key ID `AKIAQUUXEXCMMQ2EYQGD` and Secret Key `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`.
  - The `AKI...` account only has permission to fetch the file, listing all files in the bucket is disabled -- no cheating by listing the files!).

Have fun!
