# CS 240 Overview

**CS 240** is a core Computer Science course that designed as an alternative to the (CS 233 + CS 241) sequence of courses to provide you a strong foundation in computer architecture and systems programming in a single semester.  In addition to covering the primary topics found in 233/241, CS 240 provides you a deep introduction to cloud-based infrastructure from a cloud-first prospective, covering systems from the point of view of running platforms, infrastructure, and services (ex: PaaS, IaaS, and SaaS).


## What topics are covered in each course?

We've prepared a topic overview that provides a lecture-by-lecture comparison for all three courses.  You can view the detailed sheet here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17v65pfAYT8iNIguW-t1ItTWhew-RZ1ik-uP3_OU1TIM/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17v65pfAYT8iNIguW-t1ItTWhew-RZ1ik-uP3_OU1TIM/edit#gid=0)

At a high level:

- CS 233 will go more in-depth in circuit design, CPU design, CPU operations, and you will program in an assembly language (MIPS).  In CS 240, you will see the basics of circuit design, CPU design and operations, and you will see what assembly code looks like -- in case you ever need it.

- CS 241 will go more in-depth in low-level system calls, raw networking sockets, CPU scheduling, disk scheduling, and disk I/O.  In CS 240, you will see still see threading/multiprogramming, basic synchronization, networking, and memory management (including the classic "malloc MP" that I created for CS 241 ten years ago, but updated for CS 240).

- CS 240 will spends the last five weeks of the course covering topics not covered in either CS 233 and CS 241, primarily focused on cloud-based technologies.  This includes a microservices, APIs (ex: RESTful HTTP APIs), containers (docker), virtualization, and systems/platform architecture.


## What are the advantages of taking CS 240?

CS 240 may have topics that better fit your interests (ex: microservices, cloud, containers, etc) than CS 233 + CS 241.

Additionally, CS 240 is 3 credit hours (instead of 8 credit hours for CS 233 + CS 241).  You will still be required to complete the same number of total credit hours, so a typical student would take (CS 240 + 2x 400-level courses) **or** (CS 233 + CS 241).


## What are the disadvantages of taking CS 240?

If you take CS 240, you cannot earn credit for CS 241.

Additionally, there are specific computer architecture and systems that require CS 233 and/or CS 241 as they build on the advanced topics covered in those courses not covered in CS 240.  (See full list below.)


## What courses can you take after CS 240?

Almost all 400-level CS courses are open to you after completing CS 240.  In general, CS has eight "focus areas" and you will be completely prepared for six of the focus areas with CS 240.  Only the architecture (CS 233) and systems (CS 241) focus areas are limited to you if you choose CS 240.

- Prepared for "Software Foundations" Focus Area courses
- Prepared for "Algorithms and Models of Computation" Focus Area courses
- Prepared for "Intelligence and Big Data" Focus Area courses
- Prepared for "Human and Social Impact" Focus Area courses
- Prepared for "Media" Focus Area courses
- Prepared for "Scientific, Parallel, and High Performance Computing" Focus Area courses
- Limited Access to the "Distributed Systems, Networking, and Security" Focus Area courses
- Limited Access to the "Machines" Focus Area courses

Some of the courses from these last two focus areas are in the following list.  If you think you may want to take any of these specific courses, you should NOT take CS 240:

- CS 423: Operating Systems Design requires CS 241 (or ECE 391)
- CS 425: Distributed Systems requires CS 241 (or ECE 391)
- CS 431: Embedded Systems requires CS 241 (or ECE 391)
- CS 433: Computer System Organization requires CS 233
- CS 434: Mobile Computing & Application requires CS 241 (or ECE 391)
- CS 439: Wireless Networks requires CS 241 (or ECE 391)



## Who can take CS 240?

CS 240 is a new course and will slowly get added to the various CS curriculums.

### CS+X and Stat&CS Majors

Most CS+X majors can fulfill the systems/architecture requirement with either of two options:

- Take CS 233 **and** CS 241 *(8 total credit hours)*
- Take CS 240 *(3 credit hours)*
- (Note that you still need the same total number of credit hours, so taking CS 240 will free up some credit hours for electives or other required courses as part of your degree.)

As of Spring 2021, the specifics are:

- CS+Advertising **curriculum specifically requires CS 240** and cannot substitute CS 233 + CS 241.
- CS+Animal Sciences and CS+Crop Science **includes CS 240 by default**; a petition with the academic office is required to take CS 233 + CS 241 so you will need to talk to your academic adviser.
- All other CS+X majors and Stat&CS **includes CS 233 + CS 241 by default**; a petition with the academic office is required to take CS 233 + CS 241 so you will need to talk to your academic adviser.
- Math&CS and CS/ENG **curriculum specifically requires CS 233 + CS 241** and cannot substitute CS 240.

You should always check with your academic adviser to be certain that you complete a petition **before** you take for CS 240 (or CS 233 + CS 241) to ensure you'll earn credit towards graduation.

### CS Minors

The current [CS minor](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/undergraduate/degree-program-options/minor-computer-science) requires the completion of CS 125, CS 173, and CS 225, and three additional CS courses.  CS 240 can be used as one of the three additional CS courses.

Fall 2021 will likely see an updated CS minor. This updated minor will likely require more courses before CS 225, and won't have enough room to fit CS 240.


### CS/Engineering Majors and Math&CS Majors

Math&CS and CS/ENG **curriculum specifically requires CS 233 + CS 241** and cannot substitute CS 240.
